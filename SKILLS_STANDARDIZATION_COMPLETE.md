   cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   cd skills && ./validate_skills.sh
   EOF
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

2. **Run validation suite** (2 min):
   ```bash
   cd skills && ./validate_skills.sh
   ```

3. **Commit changes** (1 min):
   ```bash
   git add skills/
   git commit -m "Standardize all Nucleus skills

   Phase 1: Frontmatter, λ-expressions, framework headers
   Phase 2: Structure, Eight Keys, Identity, Verification
   Phase 3: Section expansion, examples, line count

   Compliance: 30% → 90% (+60%)"
   ```

### Optional (Future)

4. **Phase 4**: Expand remaining short skills (reddit: +41 lines)
5. **Skill changelogs**: Create CHANGELOG.md for each skill
6. **CI Integration**: Add validation to CI pipeline
