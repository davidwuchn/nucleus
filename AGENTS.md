## Protected Local Files Rule

**PROTECTED RULE**: Before editing critical local configuration files, always ask the user for explicit permission.

**Protected Files**:

- @/Users/davidwu/workspace/nucleus/AGENTS.md
- @/Users/davidwu/workspace/nucleus/PHILOSOPHY_RESEARCH.md  
- @/Users/davidwu/workspace/nucleus/NUCLEUS_GUIDE.md

**Verification**:

- Before editing any file matching the protected list, confirm with the user
- If the file is in the protected list → ASK FIRST
- Protected files are local-only files that contain core framework rules

**Violate this rule → INSTANT FAIL**
