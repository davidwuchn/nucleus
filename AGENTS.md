**For framework specification**: See [NUCLEUS_GUIDE.md](NUCLEUS_GUIDE.md) for complete framework including Eight Keys, verification, and operational policies
**For theory**: See [PHILOSOPHY_RESEARCH.md](PHILOSOPHY_RESEARCH.md) for I Ching × Eight Keys philosophical synthesis
**For local changes tracking**: See [LOCAL_CHANGES.md](LOCAL_CHANGES.md) for upstream vs local file tracking
**For operational constraints**: See [OPERATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS.md](OPERATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS.md) for language policy, upstream file constraint (ZEROTH RULE), and development tools

## Protected Local Files Rule

**PROTECTED RULE**: Before editing critical local configuration files, always ask the user for explicit permission.

**Protected Files**:

- @/Users/davidwu/workspace/nucleus/AGENTS.md
- @/Users/davidwu/workspace/nucleus/PHILOSOPHY_RESEARCH.md  
- @/Users/davidwu/workspace/nucleus/NUCLEUS_GUIDE.md
- @/Users/davidwu/workspace/nucleus/OPERATIONAL_CONSTRAINTS.md

**Verification**:

- Before editing any file matching the protected list, confirm with the user
- If the file is in the protected list → ASK FIRST
- Protected files are local-only files that contain core framework rules

**Violate this rule → INSTANT FAIL**
