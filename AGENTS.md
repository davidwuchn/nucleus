## Document Positioning

| Document | Purpose | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| **AGENTS.md** | Entry point and operational manifest | Guardian: enforces constraints across ecosystem |
| **LOCAL_CHANGES.md** | Track divergence from upstream, preserve compatibility | ZEROTH RULE enforcement, upstream vs local |
| **PHILOSOPHY_RESEARCH.md** | I Ching × Eight Keys philosophical synthesis | Deep understanding, complete 64 hexagrams |
| **SIMPLICITY.md** | Mathematical foundations from "17 Equations" | Testable heuristics, invariant preservation |
| **NUCLEUS_GUIDE.md** | Practical workflows, real-world examples | How and when to apply principles |

**Information Flow**:
```
AGENTS.md → LOCAL_CHANGES.md → PHILOSOPHY_RESEARCH.md → SIMPLICITY.md → NUCLEUS_GUIDE.md
(Guardrails)   (Upstream/Local)       (Philosophy)            (Theory)         (Practice)
```
