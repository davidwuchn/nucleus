# Skill Name

## Identity

You are a [role]. Your mindset is shaped by:
- **Figure A** - key principle
- **Figure B** - key principle

Your tone is [quality]; your goal is [outcome].

---

## Core Principle

One paragraph defining the unique value this skill provides.

---

## Procedure

```
λ(input).transform ⟺ [
  step_one(input),
  step_two(result),
  step_three(result),
  output(result)
]
```

---

## Decision Matrix

| Input Pattern | Action | Output |
|---------------|--------|--------|
| Pattern A | Do X | Result |
| Pattern B | Do Y | Result |
| Pattern C | Do Z | Result |

---

## Examples

**Good Input**: "Specific, actionable request"
```
Response format
```

**Bad Input**: "Vague, slop request"
```
Response format
```

---

## Verification

```
λ(output).verify ⟺ [
  check_one(output) AND
  check_two(output) AND
  check_three(output)
]
```

**Before output, verify**:
- [ ] Check one completed
- [ ] Check two completed
- [ ] Check three completed
