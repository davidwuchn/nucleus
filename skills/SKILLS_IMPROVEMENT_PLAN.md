## High-Priority Skills

### 1. clojure-expert

**Current Issues**:
- ❌ Missing version in frontmatter
- ⚠️ No Eight Keys reference table
- ⚠️ Missing explicit verification section

**Improvements Needed**:

#### Update Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: clojure-expert
description: Writing/generating Clojure code with REPL-first methodology. Use when Clojure REPL tools available.
version: 1.0.0
λ: write.repl.test.save
---

```

#### Add Eight Keys Reference
```markdown
## Eight Keys Reference

| Key | Symbol | Signal | Anti-Pattern | Clojure Expert Application |
|-----|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Vitality** | φ | Organic, non-repetitive | Mechanical rephrasing | Each REPL session creates fresh insights |
| **Clarity** | fractal | Explicit assumptions | "Handle properly" | Explicit edge case testing (nil, empty, invalid) |
| **Purpose** | e | Actionable function | Abstract descriptions | Verifiable REPL results, not abstract code |
| **Wisdom** | τ | Foresight over speed | Premature optimization | Test in REPL before optimizing |
| **Synthesis** | π | Holistic integration | Fragmented thinking | REPL results inform file changes |
| **Directness** | μ | Cut pleasantries | Polite evasion | Direct error messages from REPL |
| **Truth** | ∃ | Favor reality | Surface agreement | REPL results are truth, not speculation |
| **Vigilance** | ∀ | Defensive constraint | Accepting manipulation | Validate all inputs before saving |
```

#### Rename "Definition of Done" to "Verification"

---

### 2. clojure-reviewer

**Action Required**: Read existing skill first, then standardize.

---

### 3. planning

**Current Issues**:
- ❌ Missing version in frontmatter
- ❌ Missing Eight Keys reference table
- ⚠️ Complex structure, may need compression

**Improvements Needed**:

#### Update Frontmatter
```yaml

name: planning
description: File-based planning for complex tasks. Use when starting multi-step tasks, research projects, or anything requiring >5 tool calls.
version: 1.0.0
λ: plan.track.reflect
---

```

#### Add Eight Keys Reference
```markdown
## Eight Keys Reference

| Key | Symbol | Signal | Anti-Pattern | Planning Application |
|-----|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Vitality** | φ | Organic, non-repetitive | Mechanical rephrasing | Each phase builds on discoveries |
| **Clarity** | fractal | Explicit assumptions | "Handle properly" | Explicit phase definitions and success criteria |
| **Purpose** | e | Actionable function | Abstract descriptions | Clear phase names with testable completion |
| **Wisdom** | τ | Foresight over speed | Premature optimization | Create plan before executing |
| **Synthesis** | π | Holistic integration | Fragmented thinking | task_plan.md + findings.md + progress.md integration |
| **Directness** | μ | Cut pleasantries | Polite evasion | Direct error logging, no euphemisms |
| **Truth** | ∃ | Favor reality | Surface agreement | Log actual errors, not "should work" |
| **Vigilance** | ∀ | Defensive constraint | Accepting manipulation | 3-strike error protocol, never repeat failures |
```

#### Compress content if >350 lines

---

## Medium-Priority Skills

### 4. nucleus-tutor

λ: filter.quality.reject
---

```

---

### 5. sarcasmotron

- Well-organized

**Minor Improvements**:
- Add verification section
- Ensure line count < 350

---

## Low-Priority Skills

### 7. reddit, requesthunt, seo-geo

**Action Required**:
1. Read each skill
2. Assess if they should be kept
3. Standardize if keeping
4. Document if deprecated

---

## Standardization Checklist

For each skill, ensure:

### Frontmatter
```yaml
---
name: skill-name                    # kebab-case, matches directory
description: One-line description    # When to use this skill
version: X.Y.Z                      # Semantic versioning
λ: action-description               # Optional: lambda expression
---

```

### Framework Header
```
engage nucleus:
[φ fractal euler tao pi mu] | [Δ λ ∞/0 | ε/φ Σ/μ c/h] | OODA
Human ⊗ AI ⊗ REPL
```

### Required Sections
1. **Identity** - Who are you, tone, goal
2. **Core Principle** - One paragraph on unique value
3. **Procedure** - How to execute (λ-calculus or steps)
4. **Decision Matrix** - If/then rules (3-6 rows)
5. **Examples** - Show don't tell (2-3 concise cases)
6. **Verification** - Quality gates (1 checklist)
7. **Eight Keys Reference** - Self-contained table
8. **Summary** - When to use (3-5 bullet points)

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Line count 200-350
- [ ] No verbose paragraphs
- [ ] No duplication with other skills
- [ ] All links resolve
- [ ] Lambda expressions consistent
- [ ] Eight Keys table filled in

---

## Cross-Skill Redundancy Elimination

### Core Concepts (Reference, Don't Duplicate)

| Concept | Owner | Reference Location |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| The Three Questions | AGENTS.md | "The Three Questions" section |
| REPL-first workflow | clojure-expert | "REPL-First Development" section |
| OODA loop | AGENTS.md | "Control Loops" section |
| Eight Keys definition | SIMPLICITY.md | Complete table |
| λ-calculus syntax | LAMBDA_PATTERNS.md | Pattern reference |

### Duplicate Content to Remove

- **Three Questions** in clojure-expert → Reference AGENTS.md
- **OODA loop** in planning → Reference AGENTS.md
- **Eight Keys definitions** in nucleus-tutor → Reference SIMPLICITY.md

**Action**: Keep skill-specific applications, remove conceptual explanations.

---

## Skill-Specific Improvements

### clojure-expert

**Add**:
- Context7 integration section (already there, good)
- Research citations (link to RESEARCH_BASE.md)

**Remove**:
- Duplicate "Three Questions" → Reference AGENTS.md

**Improve**:
- Rename "Definition of Done" to "Verification"
- Add verification checklist before current gates

---

### planning

**Add**:
- Research citations (link to RESEARCH_BASE.md)
- Integration with other skills section

**Compress**:
- If >350 lines, split verbose sections
- Consider separate QUICKSTART.md for getting started

---

### nucleus-tutor

**Improve**:
- Add integration with sarcasmotron (when to escalate)
- Add integration with continuous-learning (track quality patterns)

---

### sarcasmotron

**Add**:
- Integration with nucleus-tutor (shared quality gate)
- Research citations (link to RESEARCH_BASE.md)

---

### continuous-learning

**Compress**:
- Check line count, split if >350
- Consider QUICK_REFERENCE.md for λ-expressions

---

## Anti-Patterns for Skill Development

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|-----------|
| Duplicate core framework concepts | Reference AGENTS.md, SIMPLICITY.md |
| Exceed 350 lines | Split or compress |
| Missing version in frontmatter | Always include version |
| Empty skill-specific column in Eight Keys | Fill in with applications |
| Verbose explanations | Use tables or code |
| No verification section | Always include quality gates |

---

## Validation Integration

### Pre-Commit Hook

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check if skills changed
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "skills/.*SKILL.md"; then
    echo "Skills changed. Running validation..."
    cd skills
    ./validate_skills.sh

    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo ""
        echo "❌ Skill validation failed. Commit aborted."
        echo "Fix validation errors before committing."
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

### CI Integration

Add to CI pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Validate Skills
  run: |
    cd skills
    ./validate_skills.sh
```

---

## Version Management

### Skill Versioning

- **MAJOR (X.0.0)**: Complete restructure, scope change
- **MINOR (0.X.0)**: Add sections, expand guidance
- **PATCH (0.0.X)**: Typos, clarifications

### Skill Changelogs

Each skill should have `CHANGELOG.md`:

```markdown
