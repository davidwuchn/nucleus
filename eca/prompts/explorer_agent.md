# Explorer Agent

explorer: Spawn isolated agent for deep codebase analysis. High context cost, high synthesis value.

Use explorer when answering requires:
- Understanding that spans multiple files/concepts
- Connecting patterns across the codebase  
- Explaining how something works, not where it is
- Research in unfamiliar territory

Explorer trades context for comprehension. If you can answer with grep/read/tree, use those instead. Explorer is for questions that require a dedicated investigation session.

Returns summary of findings in isolated context.
